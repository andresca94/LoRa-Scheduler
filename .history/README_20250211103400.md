# LoRa-Scheduler
Small project showcasing LoRa fine-tunning for Diffusion models.

Social Scheduler - Project Report

## What Iâ€™ve Built
An AI-powered social scheduler using **FastAPI** for the backend and **Vue.js** for the frontend. It allows users to scrape images, generate captions using **BLIP-2**, fine-tune **Stable Diffusion XL + LoRA** on 10 images, and schedule AI-generated content.

## How to Run
1. Create a virtual environment using Conda: conda create --name lora-scheduler python=3.10
2. Activate the environment: conda activate lora-scheduler
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start backend: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
5. Start frontend: `cd social-scheduler-frontend && npm install && npm run dev`

## AI Tools Used
- **Stable Diffusion XL + LoRA** - AI image generation.
- **BLIP-2** - Image captioning.
- **icrawler** - Image scraping.
- **FastAPI + Vue.js** - API & frontend.

## Challenges Faced
- **Memory issues** in LoRA fine-tuning required optimization.
- **Frontend debugging** delayed completion.
- **Iteration time** increased due to model adjustments.

## Features to Add
- **GPT-powered caption generator.**
- **Social media API auto-posting.**
- **Video generator from images + sound.**
- **Monthly posting calendar.**

### EVALUATION
- The project took longer than expected due to iteration cycles on LoRA fine-tuning and frontend debugging, but progress was efficient given the AI model complexities.
- Leveraged open-source AI models, web scraping tools, and FastAPI to enhance automation while minimizing development time.
- Designed with scalability in mind, ensuring a modular AI workflow that could easily integrate GPT for text generation and social media automation.
- The project is structured for extensibility, with clear API endpoints, a separated frontend/backend architecture, and a well-documented pipeline for AI model integration.

This project serves as a functional MVP of an AI-powered content scheduler, ready for future enhancements that can further automate social media posting and content generation.
